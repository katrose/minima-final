## Impressions

I looooooove Kyousuke Motomi. She wowed me with *Dengeki Daisy*, a title that on the surface might seem like standard rom-com fare, but is in reality a layered story about guilt and self-forgiveness.

*QQ Sweeper*, though? I dunno. I wasn’t feeling it. I suppose I can’t knock on it too much knowing it’s actually a prequel, but stories that are part of a series should still be able to stand on their own, right?

### The Good

*   Motomi’s knack for protective, devoted male characters shows itself again here with the character of Kyutaro
*   Literal cleaning to demonstrate psychological cleaning, therapy, cleansing one’s mind, etc, is a unique and interesting idea
*   Kyutaro a standout character, very different from Kurosaki (Dengeki Daisy) – more vulnerable and willing to admit his loneliness; his love and pining for Fuyu/Fumi is really moving
*   Dengeki Daisy cameos were cute

### The Bad

*   Motomi’s male protagonists all look the same!
*   Fumi's character isn't fleshed out very well and it makes the ending more jarring when we realize her role is going to change significantly in the story

## Final Thoughts

Supernatural elements are unique but the story is boring mostly due to limp world-building and a lack of character development.
