## Takane & Hana by Yuki Shiwasu

Creepy due to age gap. I couldn't believe it when the author tried to be all cheeky and asked readers not to take the story too seriously in a sidebar note. Like, the dude is 26 and the girl is 16. You can't just handwave that shit away. Why couldn't the author simply bump up the age of the girl to like, 20 or 21? The story would have been exactly the same. Blegh.

## Anonymous Noise by Ryoko Fukuyama

On paper, ***Anonymous Noise*** offers a story about love, friendship, and the sacrifices you need to make to pursue your dream. But the end result is messy and disappointing. It lacks maturity and believable drama, and the characters are too one-note for the reader to really connect with them. They don't have that much going on besides the surface-level stuff, i.e. Nino is a girl that loves to sing, Yuzu is the token *tsundere*, and there isn't enough of Momo yet but from what I've seen I'm honestly not that intrigued. There is an undercurrent of sadness and loss that's running through the story so far and I'm curious enough to keep reading to see if the author does anything with it. But I might just have to accept that ***Anonymous Noise*** ain't for me.

## The Young Master's Revenge by Meca Tanaka

This started out cute, but the implications of Tenma living with Leo and owing him money are a little creepy. Especially since he's still plotting revenge against her. We all know he's making excuses and that he's just in love with her or whatever, but the imbalance in the relationship from the get-go is too skeevy to ignore. I know it's a silly romance and I'm reading too much into it, but I'm kinda over the "rich dude rescues destitute girl and makes her depend on him" trope.

The translation is all right. (Not sure anyone can make "Drat this girl!" sound okay in any context, though.) The lettering is quite good.

## Final Thoughts

Maybe I'm getting Too Old for most Shojo Beat titles. That's okay. But I also kinda wish these publishers would put out the same amount of *josei* series... Please, Viz...
