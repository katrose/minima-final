When Seven Seas announced that they'd licensed *Our Dreams at Dusk*, I was beside myself with excitement. That title! The cover! It was marketed as a "powerful, realistic manga about a broad LGBT+ community," and "a beautiful tale of coming out and coming of age." I knew nothing about this series, but it sounded right up my alley. 

Sadly, I did not fall in love with it like I thought I would.

The biggest reason I couldn't enjoy this was because I didn't like some of the English translation choices. 

One, the [Japanese honorifics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics) are retained in the translation, which is so unnecessary for this kind of story. I'm one of those readers who wishes publishers would just err on the side of no honorifics ever unless it's in an archaic/formal Japanese setting or something, but even then, I could do without them.

Two, a certain character's name is translated literally as "Someone-san". As in, other people in the story actually refer to this person by name as "Someone-san" (because nobody knows their real name.) I'm sorry but... No. It sounds so awkward it actually breaks immersion for me. It makes me feel like I'm reading a bootleg amateur translation off the internet. I *know* that sounds harsh! I don't say it lightly. I'm sure the translating team talked about how they should approach that character's name and if they should include honorifics for the whole series. Maybe that decision came from the author herself. I have no idea. All I know is that as a reader, the end result sounds... Not good.

(I was so bothered by the English translation that I checked out the French edition and was relieved to see that that version actually opted for a non-literal translation for "Someone-san" and simply wrote around it depending on the scene, i.e. the characters would not refer to her explicitly by name.)

Anyway, just going by this first volume, I'm kinda glad I read a library copy before buying it. I'll still check out the rest of the series, but I'm definitely less enthused about it.
