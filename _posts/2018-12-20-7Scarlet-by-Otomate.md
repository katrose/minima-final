## First Impressions
When the game started with Hino feeling entitled to Ichiko's affection simply because he was her childhood friend, I felt my heart sink a little. Was this gonna be one of those *otome* games with laughably outdated attitudes about women? Was Ichiko gonna be another doormat heroine? The short answer is... unfortunately... yes. 

Still, I think 7'Scarlet pays off in the end, *if* you're willing to slog through the first half of the game.

## Characters/Routes

**Hino Kagutsuchi** is... well, as stated, he's Ichiko's childhood friend. He's handsome. Athletic. Protective. He also gets unreasonably frustrated whenever Ichiko rebuffs his advances (unknowingly, of course). How dare Ichiko not reciprocate his feelings?!?!?! I hated him right off the bat and those feelings didn't change much by the end of his route. 

**Isora Amari** is *slightly* more palatable on account of his teasing ways and his friendly disposition. But um... well, let's just say the comparisons to Toma from Amnesia are totally justified. And this route has the same problems as Hino's, mainly that the story goes absolutely nowhere. 

**Toa Kushinada**'s route was fun. I remember being pleasantly surprised after finishing his route. But again, nothing super memorable for me. 

**Sosuke Takehira**'s route is where it starts getting good. The plot picks up, secrets are revealed, and the main themes of the story finally come into focus. The romance is also a step up from the first three routes.

**Yuzuki Murakumo** is my favorite, in terms of character and overall route. His Normal/Tragic End is amazing, and probably even better than the Good Ending. 

**Hanate Yatsukami's** route made me gag (lol) but the writing was so nice and goddamn I can't resist Hikaru Midorikawa's voice.   

## Visuals

The background art is really lovely in this game. But it makes the character sprites look kinda garish in comparison. The sprites are colored in this jarring way that makes them look like cutout dolls from extra glossy magazine paper. Not a dealbreaker, just a minor quibble. 

## Translation

I've played two other games published by Aksys: *Hakuoki*, which had a writing style I enjoyed, and *Amnesia*, which I found to be unremarkable and sometimes overly literal. *7'Scarlet* wasn't as impressive as *Hakuoki* was in terms of script quality, but it also wasn't as frustrating to read as *Amnesia*. But these are some of the issues I had:

### Literal Translations

One major annoyance in the reading experience is when you can sense that Japanese sentence structure was preserved in the English translation. Like this: 

![7-Scarlet Literal Translation Example](/assets/img/is-what-id-like-to-say.png)

"...is what I'd like to say" is a literal translation. Using it once or twice would've been fine, but it pops up *a lot* in the game. It sounds awkward in English and I would've liked for it to be reworded as much as possible. 

### Dialogue Tags
Serious question: Why on earth do visual novels still use dialogue tags?!

This looks so awkward! Visual novels don't need dialogue tags like traditional prose does! We already know who's speaking because of the VISUALS! 

## Final Thoughts
I'm mostly critical of *7'Scarlet*, but I was actually quite moved by the story. The localization team did polish all the parts that mattered; all the emotional scenes had some pretty nice writing. The climax in the final route was a pleasure to read in spite of all the creepy implications.
