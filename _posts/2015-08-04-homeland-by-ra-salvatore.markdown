Honest to God, I try not to be a damn snob when it comes to people's reading preferences... I read lots of trash and enjoy it, after all... but the popularity of these books makes me scratch my head in confusion. 

*Homeland* is the origin story of a drow elf named Drizzt Do'Urden. The book starts off describing drow elf culture: society is ruled by a matriarchal hierarchy that worships the eeevvviiilll Spider Goddess Lolth, who favors chaos above all. The city of Menzoberranzan, home to all drow elves, is literally and figuratively a dark place where everyone backstabs each other to advance their rank in the hierarchy. This is the world into which Drizzt is born. The story follows his early life: his upbringing, his training, and the events that lead to his rejection of drow elf society.

Drizzt is the main reason I hate this book. He's a frustratingly depthless character, someone who is just born good, no questions asked. This makes NO SENSE, given how stifling and relentless drow society is with its indoctrination. Why is Drizzt the only one in his generation who questions how evil drow culture is? Where does his idealism even come from? It's never clear, although the book's implicit answer seems to be that it's because he's the son of another idealistic character. The foundation of Drizzt's relative "goodness" is never really laid out properly, which makes it hard for me as the reader to relate to Drizzt's internal struggle against the bigger forces of society.

I'm not even gonna talk about the secondary cast, which is entirely one-dimensional and forgettable. Zaknafein is an exception, but like Drizzt, it's not really clear to me why he is the way he is.

The blandness of Drizzt and everyone else wouldn't have annoyed me so much if the narrative were a bit more complex. There was so much good material here that could've been explored: Drizzt's search for his identity, questions of nature vs. nurture, resisting the bad influences of society, etc etc, but Salvatore never really expounds on these themes in any kind of satisfying way, and this thematic void only highlights the flatness of the characters.

Ultimately I think it's the constraints of the D&D universe that make this book so shitty. Salvatore makes everything and everyone in this book fit a certain black-and-white D&D role and does nothing more with it. *Dungeons & Dragons* started out as a tabletop game with magic and battles so there's gotta be magic and battles in the book. Lolth and the drow are Evil and so Salvatore comically gives them no nuance whatsoever, they are simply the baaaad villains from whom Drizzt must break free. There's magical animal companions and monsters and fucking fireballs or whatever BUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF IT ALL???!! Without a believable conflict and emotional stakes, without even a central theme tying all of it together, all the *Dungeons & Dragons* fantasy trappings are just background noise.
