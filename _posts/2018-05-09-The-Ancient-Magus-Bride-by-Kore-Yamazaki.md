General notes: **The Ancient Magus' Bride** has one of the best translations I've ever read in a manga. These books actually read like fantasy prose novels. Translation was done by Adrienne Beck, adaptation by Ysabet Reinhardt MacFarlane.

## Volume 5

### Arc 1
A leannán sídhe (from Celtic folklore) visits Chise and asks for help because her old lover, Joel, is dying. Leannán sídhe are creatures who fall in love with human men and gift them with inspiration, but consume these men's lives in exchange. Leannán sídhe are invisible to normal humans, however, so Joel has never been able to see her despite being aware of her presence. On his deathbed, Joel expresses his fears to Elias (in human form); Elias tells Joel he only has a week left to live. Overhearing this, Chise decides to make fairy ointment for Joel--this ointment can be placed on the eyelids of a human to allow them to see the fae. Chise succeeds: Joel and the leannán sídhe are able to say goodbye. Chise weeps and Elias asks her if what she's feeling is called "grief" (the panel sequence & art here is soooo good, I actually teared up a little)

### Arc 2
Chise collapses after overworking herself to make the fairy ointment; she used too much magic. Elias takes her to Tir na Nog to get treated by a changeling doctor named Shannon. Shannon explains to Chise some of the mechanics of magic: magic runs through mages' veins, and that by generating too much magical energy it's possible to cause one's internal organs to rupture, which is what happened to Chise.

Meanwhile, Titania, Queen of the Faeries, suggests to Elias that he and Chise stay in Tir na Nog because the mortal world is harmful to their kind, including Chise, who is more fae than human due to her being a sleigh beggy. Elias might be able to bear it, but Chise risks an early death if exposed to the mortal world for too long. Elias explains that humans have accepted him, unlike the fae who continue to look down on him and pity him, and for these reasons he wishes for Chise to continue life as a human.

Thanks to Shannon, Chise is able to find her will to heal. Chise and Elias return home, only to find it covered in snow: autumn has passed entirely since they were gone, since time flows differently between the worlds.

### Arc 3
While Chise and Elias were away, the Silver Lady was left to tend to the house. Through a flashback, we learn that she used to be a banshee, and that she lost her purpose once the last of her family died. After a long period of wandering aimlessly, she is found by Spriggan, who transforms her into a Silky, her present form, so that she can care for a new home.

## Volume 6

### Arc 1
Chise and Alice go to London to buy Christmas presents for their mentors. Chise leaves without Elias' permission but Elias notices anyway and spies on her by sending a creature to follow her. We get a flashback of Alice's life on the streets and how she and Renfred met. We learn that Renfred lost his left eye protecting Alice from a spirit in his library. Chise and Elias exchange presents: a pendant for Elias and a handmade teddy bear for Chise.

*Alice makes another mention of the "College" which has been foreshadowed in previous chapters as well.

### Arc 2
Chise and Elias help Stella, a young British girl, find her lost brother Ethan. They learn that Ethan was kidnapped by an ancient creature called Ashen Eye, who overheard Stella and Ethan fighting and took their harsh words to heart. Ashen Eye suggests they play a game, and hides both Elias and Ethan somewhere for Stella and Chise to find. With the help of her wolf pelt, Chise is finally able to locate them.

### Arc 3
Stella and Chise are now friends after the ordeal with Ashen Eye. Stella visits Chise and gifts the household with baked goods in exchange for Chise and Elias' help, as promised. Elias behaves strangely during Stella's visit and retreats to his study. As Stella is about to leave, Chise notices Elias sneaking away from the house in his animal form. Chise transforms into a wolf to catch up to him. Elias traps her in... his weird monster form with tentacles... (my mind was kind of in the gutter here, not gonna lie lmao) Elias explains what he felt when Stella visited the house and Chise realizes that Elias is jealous (and kinda possessive, with the way he constricts Chise in this scene).

*I was unnerved by this scene but I like that the author keeps reminding the readers that yes, Elias is trying to understand human emotion, but he's still very much a monster (or "inhuman" as the author describes).
