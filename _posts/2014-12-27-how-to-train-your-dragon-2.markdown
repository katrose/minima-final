My reaction to ***HTTYD2*** was mostly negative. I am pretty unforgiving when it comes to narrative cohesion, pacing and thematic resonance in a story. 

"But Katherine!" you shriek. "This is a movie for kids! It's meant to sell toys!" Okay, YEAH, but there's plenty of media for children out there that can market toys *and* be meaningful! Raise the bar, people!

In any case, I kinda wanna sort my thoughts out as I write them to see if my ire is merited or if I'm just being overly critical, which I tend to be.

The story is as follows: Five years after the end of the first ***How to Train Your Dragon*** movie, the citizens of Berk are now living harmoniously with dragons. Hiccup and Toothless are still the best of pals, and together they fly in search of new lands. Hiccup's father, Berk's current chieftain, wants him to assume his duties as the future chief, but Hiccup is reluctant. So here we have conflict numero uno: Hiccup isn't sure he has what it takes to become chief. 

But he doesn't have time to worry about all that, because another threat looms in the distance! In comes Drago Bludvist, a dragon hunter who, by way of corny flashback, is revealed to be mad with lust for power and dominance. He wants to steal dragons and use them to conquer the world. Hiccup wants to try to reason with Bludvist, but his father insists on all-out war because there is no reasoning with madmen. Conflict numero dos: dragon-hating villain vs. dragon-loving protagonists.

So at this point, I can kind of see what the writers (maybe) tried to do. The Bludvist situation should have been the perfect opportunity for Hiccup to assert his leadership, rally his allies, rescue the dragons, defeat bad guy. Hiccup would then realize he in fact does have what it takes to be chief. Boom, character arc. Bad guy loses. Happy ending.

Except it didn't really work out that way. Well it did, but it felt totally half-assed. Why, you ask?

About a third of a way into the movie enters another character, a masked vigilante who shares Hiccup's affinity for dragons and rescues them from harm. As Hiccup makes his way towards Bludvist, he gets ambushed by this vigilante and brought to their lair. This sequence is probably my favorite part of the movie. The face-off between Hiccup and Mysterious Dragon Rescuer in the cave is tense and exciting, and the reveal at the end of this sequence is actually a nice surprise: it's Hiccup's long-lost mom! GASP!!! I was totally into it, but I also kinda wished the moment had more build up and foreshadowing. The reveal almost feels like it comes out of nowhere.

And that's the main problem I have with the story: it's too busy. There's so much going on, it's hard to give a crap about any of it. Does it really matter that Hiccup's mom comes back into the picture when her son and husband were doing just fine without her? Yes, it's a shocking moment but the script gave us no real reason to care before the reveal. 

The introduction of Hiccup's mother and the family dynamic stuff--which I personally thought was way more interesting than everything else the movie was trying to do--gets lost in all the other shit going on. Which is too bad, because the family relationships should have been the emotional center of the movie.
