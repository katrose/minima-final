My name is Katherine Picazo and I'm currently in Calgary studying web development.

This site is mostly about some of my hobbies, namely reading *manga* (Japanese comics) and playing video games. I used to keep diaries as a teenager, and that's how I developed a writing habit. I don't really journal anymore, but over the years I've recorded some thoughts about the media I consume.
